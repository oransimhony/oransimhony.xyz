Hi! I'm Oran.
This is my site where I write about various things.
I'm interested in technology, languages (both human and programming ones), FLOSS and more.

I'm currently working on the [[https://oransimhony.xyz/tags/luka][Luka programming language]], which is a small general-purpose programming language built on top of C and LLVM which has sensible defaults taken from the modern programming approach.
